This script uses Vim's "sign" capability to provide visual marks, similar to UltraEdit's bookmark. 

1.  For gvim, use "Ctrl + F2" to toggle a visual mark. 
     For both vim and gvim, use "mm" to toggle a visual mark.
2.  Use "F2" to navigate through the visual marks forward in the file.
3.  Use "Shift + F2" to navigate backwards.

If you do not like the highlighting scheme, you could change "SignColor" in the script.  Feedbacks are welcome. :-)
